Have you been in a situation where you need a quick deploy for a test environment, but sadly, one or more of these things happen to you:

- You don't remember which AMI you used

- Did I install all necessary dependencies?

- Did I update my image?

If so, this JSON file in conjunction with Packer (https://www.packer.io/), will make sure you deploy an updated, consistent and fully equipped AMI Base Image, that is absolutely ready to deploy.

Bear in mind the file contains very general requirements, and it's based on the latest CentOS 7 AWS Marketplace Image as well as the latest Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, which means you must authorize your account to use it prior to building.

In the Provisioners section, feel free to add, remove and customize according to your own needs. As is, it contains the following:

* Ruby
* GNUpG
* Postgres Development Libraries
* Wget
* EPEL Repo
* Nginx
* AWS Code Deploy Agent for US East-1 *(simply change to your own AZ)

NOTE: Packer must be installed in your test system as well as have AWS access properly configured.
